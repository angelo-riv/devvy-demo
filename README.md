# 💻 Devvy

> A project-based tech challenge platform for real-world engineering prep.

##  Overview

Devvy replaces algorithmic puzzle platforms with realistic project challenges. Students build full-stack solutions, and recruiters assess candidates based on how they think — not just what they solve.

---

## Features

-  Solve real-world tasks in full-stack environments
-  Build public, peer-reviewed portfolios
-  Get challenges sourced from actual GitHub repositories
-  AI-generated prompts based on real project code
-  Recruiter dashboard (planned): view candidate submissions & feedback

##  Architecture
[ GitHub Scraper ] → [ AI Prompt Generator (ChatGPT/Gemini) ] → [ Devvy Challenge Builder ]
↓
[ Supabase DB ]
↓
[ FastAPI Backend ] ←→ [ React Frontend (Axios) ]


- GitHub scraping for real-world codebases
- AI prompt generation to create coding challenges from parsed files
- Supabase/PostgreSQL for storing users, challenges, and submissions
- FastAPI backend serves all challenge and user data
- React frontend fetches data via Axios & renders filters, portfolios, and problem views
